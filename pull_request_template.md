Hey.

I'd like to make an addition to this public blacklist by including following people:

	- *Username* (***UserID***): [a set of publicly available evidence links](an_actual_link)

I am aware that this list shall only contain the entries for the people who have abused the vulnerabilities of VRChat, and I did clear the submitted changes of unrelated people, thus every submitted person is backed with the evidence posted above.
