# VRChat Blacklist
A failsafe solution

## Eh?
This is a publicly available list of blacklisted VRChat users. With the raise of popularity of logout/crash exploits, the need in immediate solution arose. This, in turn, is a solution. Integrated with specific clientside software, this list is an opt-in shared blacklist for exploit abusers.

The clientside implementation is up to the end user, as tampering with VRChat client goes against the VRChat ToS.

This downlink list can be used directly with AK/KOS v. 1.0.0 module.
