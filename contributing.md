## Before we start
All contributions are appreciated, but unlike your personal list, this is a list for many people to share and use at the same time. This means you cannot just put some person's ID into this list and create a pull request.

As sad as it is, you'd have to supply proper evidence of someone exploiting VRChat's vulnerabilities _and messing up other people's experience_. Pull requests that do not supply any kind of suitable evidence will be rejected without review.

## How to contribute
Since master branch is protected from direct writes, every contributor has to create a branch, modify the file, then create the pull request so it will be merged with master branch, which should be used to downlink.

Keep the structure of the file in the same vein with the source, don't change the indentation or layouts. Fill in all the `Comment` fields for every entry, so the users shall not get confused when it comes to figuring out why a certain person is targeted.

Do not change the `UserName` fields, as the date of the block should correspond to the name the targeted user was using, so it is much easier to figure out why user `Foo` is being targeted, while you've clearly blocked `Bar`.
